1. Which country had the highest number of deaths on Monday (April 6 20202)?
  ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
  select(-Lat, -Long) %>% 
  filter(date == "2020-04-06", type == "death") %>% 
  arrange(-cases)

```

2. Which country had the highest count of confirmed cases in January? [Hint: to address this question the function `month()` from the package `lubridate` might be helpful]. What about in March?
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
  
library(lubridate) #install.packages('lubridate')

coronavirus %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(type == "confirmed", month == 1) %>% 
  group_by(Country.Region) %>% 
  summarize(total_death = sum(cases)) %>% 
  arrange(-total_death)
```


3. Which countries have data for multiple states or provinces?
  ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
  group_by(Country.Region, date) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  group_by(Country.Region) %>% 
  summarize(maxcount = max(n)) %>% 
  filter(maxcount > 3)

```

4. Do all countries have reports of the number of confirmed cases for the same number of days?
  ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "recovered") %>% 
  group_by(Country.Region, Province.State) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>% 
  head

```
