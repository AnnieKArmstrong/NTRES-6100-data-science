#### Course description    
As datasets grow larger and more complex across all areas of science, computational skills are increasingly in high demand. This course introduces a series of practical tools that enable researchers to spend less time wrestling with software or repeating error-prone manual data processing and more time getting research done in efficient and transparent ways that facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We will work in R/RStudio, primarily with the tidyverse packages and with Git and GitHub integration. The course emphasizes practical skill development and will be structured around hands-on (the keyboard) learning.  

**By the end of this course, students will be able to:**  

* Describe strategies for ensuring that their data analysis is reproducible  
* Demonstrate best practices for coding and project-oriented workflows in RStudio  
* Import and clean messy data files using a variety of packages and functions in R  
* Subset, reorganize, and merge diverse datasets in R  
* Effectively explore and visualize patterns in complex datasets with ggplot in R  
* Write simple functions/programs and data analysis pipelines in R  
* Automate repeated analysis tasks in R  
* Track the history of file changes (version control) and collaborate effectively on scripts with others with Git and GitHub  
* Use R Markdown to combine text, equations, code, tables, and figures into reports, websites, and presentations
