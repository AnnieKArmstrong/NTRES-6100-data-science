## Goal for today

Explore more RMarkdown functionality and practice implementing it.

## Exercise 1: Basic formatting and code chunk options

Let's start by playing around with the basic RStudio RMarkdown template a little more. Open a fresh copy by clicking File -> New File -> R Markdown... We can enter "Lab exercise" in the Title field and keep HTML as the Default Output Format.

### Basic formatting

Take a few minutes to play around with the formatting. Remember that you can find 
RStudio's built-in RMarkdown reference under Help > Markdown Quick Reference, or check out one of the many great cheatsheets you can find online, e.g. [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) or RStudio's thst you can download from [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (scroll down to find it).

## Exercise 2: Document styling and output formats

add theme
toc
Output format


Generate three reports, one as HTML, one as PDF, and one as microsoft word. Remember, if you are having PDF problems, see the note on installing `tinytex` [here](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/installation.html#a-note-on-pdf).

## Exercise 3: Make a CV

Now, practice what youâ€™ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold and add a footnote. You can also add a photo, either of yourself, or something else you have handy or can find online.

Render to html format, and if you're comfortable, share with the class by posting it to the `lecture-chat` channel in Slack.

You will have seen how quickly you can create a nicely formatted document. But there are also lots of great CV templates out there that we can use. Try one of these:
